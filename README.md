## Description

This website generates passwords according to the users preferences. When the user clicks the generate password button a series of prompts appear on the screen. The user can input how many characters long they would like their password, with a limit that this number must be between 8 and 128 characters. If the user selects a number that is not between 8 and 128 they will be alerted and the event stops. Should the user enter non numeric characters in this prompt they will also recieve the same alert stating they must use numeric characters when entering a desired password length. When the user selects a desired password length within the scope they are asked whether or not they wish to include numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters or special characters, this is confirmed by clicking OK or cancel. If the user selects cancel for all character types they will be alerted and told they must inlcude at least one type of character and the event stops; the word "undefined" will appear in the 'your secure password' box. Once the user has answered all prompts, with the length being between 8-128 characters and with at least one type of character selected, they are provided with a randomised password containing only characters they chose with their desired lenth. If the user is not satisfied with the password generated they can start the process again by clicking the generate password button. 

This webpage contains a descriptive title, two large headings, two boxes (one containing the content and one containing the password result) and a large green generate button. When the button has been activated the user will see the series of prompts, as seen in the picture below.
